# SQL Projects Repository

This repository contains structured solutions to various SQL-based homework assignments completed during a university-level **Database Systems** course. Each directory represents a project involving real-world or academic datasets, with `.sql` files answering specific queries or performing data operations.

Each folder also includes a `README.md` that describes what each `.sql` file does — making it easy to navigate and understand the logic behind the queries.
